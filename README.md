Learn the chords of guitar through photos

I built this app to learn and experiment with IBOutlets, IBActions, UIImages, and properties and methods of classes and objects.
This app also allowed me to begin playing with UI and UX in app design. I used a program called Sketch to design the app icon, splash page, and buttons.

I've been playing guitar for three years. I noticed online that the only option to learn chords are watching vidoes or finding tabs. I wanted to give an option for people to learn chords who don't have the patience for a full video and don't understand how to read tabs.

I built this app one week into the Acorn program.
